# Linux System Administration Projects

This folder contains hands-on Linux system administration work completed as part of my technical development in IT & Cybersecurity. These projects demonstrate practical skills in working with the Linux command line, organizing system resources, managing user access, and preparing file structures for real-world web application environments.

## 📂 Projects Included

| Project Name | Description | File |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Linux Files and Directories Setup** | Created a full directory structure for a web application, added HTML placeholder content, managed files using terminal tools, and tested webpage rendering. | `Lab-01-Linux-Files-and-Directories.pdf` |
| **Linux Users, Groups, and Permissions** | Configured system users based on job roles, assigned group permissions, set up role-based directory access, and enabled sudo privileges for team leads. | `Lab-02-Linux-Users-Groups-and-Permissions.pdf` |
| **Linux Processes and Services Management** | Managed system services using `systemctl`, monitored running processes, started/stopped critical services, and validated system stability. | `Lab-03-Linux-Processes-and-Services.pdf` |
| **Linux Network Services & Secure File Sharing** | Configured Apache web services, Samba file sharing for Windows clients, firewall rules, SSH access, and tested cross-platform connectivity in a secure lab environment. | `Lab-04-Linux-Network-Services.pdf` |

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Linux command-line navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, etc.)
- Creating and managing user accounts (`useradd`, `passwd`, `usermod`)
- Configuring and assigning groups
- Setting directory and file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`)
- Editing files using `vi`
- Secure password and account handling (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)
- Testing and validating configurations with GUI + CLI tools

## 🎯 Purpose and Real-World Application
These tasks reflect what system administrators and junior security analysts do daily in real environments:

- Setting up development environments
- Securing access to sensitive directories and files
- Ensuring users have the **least privilege** required to do their work
- Preparing file structures for web server hosting and deployment

This work demonstrates foundational sysadmin and DevOps readiness, which carries directly into cybersecurity roles as well.

## 🚀 Next Step
More improvements and automations will be added over time — including shell scripts and Ansible setup to configure environments automatically.

Stay tuned.
