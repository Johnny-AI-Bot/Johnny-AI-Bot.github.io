# VLAN Segmentation & Trunking

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of VLAN-based network segmentation to improve traffic isolation, security, and scalability within an enterprise network.

The lab focuses on separating departments into distinct VLANs, configuring trunk links between switches, and validating inter-VLAN communication using a router-on-a-stick approach.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- VLAN creation and assignment
- Access vs trunk ports
- IEEE 802.1Q trunking
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Network segmentation and broadcast control

## Lab Overview
- Multiple VLANs representing separate departments
- Switch-to-switch trunk links
- Router configured for inter-VLAN routing
- End devices validated for correct VLAN membership and connectivity

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS (Switching & Routing)
- VLANs and trunk configuration
- Router-on-a-stick design

## Skills Demonstrated
- Enterprise network segmentation
- Layer 2 switching concepts
- Layer 3 inter-VLAN routing
- Troubleshooting VLAN and trunk issues
