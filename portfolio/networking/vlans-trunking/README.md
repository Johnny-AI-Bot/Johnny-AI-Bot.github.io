# VLANs & Trunking

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of segmented networks using Virtual LANs (VLANs) and trunk links to separate traffic while maintaining scalability and security.

The lab focuses on implementing VLANs across access switches, configuring trunk links between switches, and validating inter-VLAN communication through proper routing.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Network segmentation using VLANs
- Access vs trunk ports
- 802.1Q trunking
- Inter-VLAN communication
- Logical separation of enterprise departments

## Lab Overview
- Multiple VLANs created to represent different departments
- Access ports assigned per VLAN
- Trunk links configured between switches
- Connectivity validated within VLAN boundaries

## Tools & Technologies
