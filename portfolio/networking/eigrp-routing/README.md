# Dynamic Routing with EIGRP

This project demonstrates the implementation of dynamic routing using Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) within a multi-router enterprise network environment.

The topology was designed to validate automatic route discovery, efficient path selection, and network scalability without relying on static routing configurations.
