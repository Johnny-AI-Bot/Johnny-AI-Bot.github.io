## 📂 Projects Included

| Project Name | Description | File |
|-------------|------------|------|
| Enterprise Network Services | Deployed and validated core enterprise services including DHCP, DNS, HTTP, and firewall rules within a segmented network environment. Verified functionality through client testing and traffic flow analysis. | enterprise-services/ |
| VLANs & Trunking | Designed segmented networks using VLANs and 802.1Q trunking to separate departmental traffic. Configured access vs trunk ports and validated inter-VLAN communication. | vlans-trunking/ |
| NAT & Address Translation | Implemented Network Address Translation (NAT) to enable private internal networks to communicate with external networks while preserving internal IP addressing. | nat/ |
| EIGRP Dynamic Routing | Configured and validated EIGRP for dynamic routing across multiple routers, demonstrating route propagation, neighbor relationships, and scalable enterprise routing design. | eigrp-routing/ |
| Hierarchical Network Design | Designed a hierarchical enterprise network model (core, distribution, access layers) to improve scalability, fault isolation, and performance. | hierarchical-network-design/ |
