# Enterprise Network Capstone Project

This capstone project integrates multiple enterprise networking concepts into a single, cohesive network design. The goal of this project is to simulate a realistic enterprise environment that emphasizes scalability, security, and structured network architecture.

---

## Project Overview

The network was designed to reflect how enterprise environments are built and managed, combining routing, switching, segmentation, and security controls into a unified topology.

---

## Architecture & Features

- Hierarchical network design (Core / Distribution / Access)
- VLAN-based segmentation for departments
- Dynamic routing using EIGRP
- Network Address Translation (NAT) for external connectivity
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enforce security policies
- Private internal addressing with controlled external access

---

## Security & Design Principles

- Least-privilege traffic flow
- Logical separation of network segments
- Centralized routing and policy enforcement
- Scalable topology suitable for enterprise growth

---

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS CLI
- Enterprise routing and switching concepts

---

## Files

- `enterprise-network-capstone.pkt` – Packet Tracer file combining routing, switching, NAT, and security controls into a single enterprise network
