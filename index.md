# John’s Cybersecurity & Cloud Portfolio

Welcome! This site collects my hands-on labs and notes across networking, security basics, Linux/Windows, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Azure.

## Networking
### 🌐 Networking & Infrastructure  
Hands-on networking projects focused on enterprise network design, segmentation, routing, and traffic analysis using Cisco Packet Tracer and Wireshark.

**Topics include:**
- VLANs & trunking
- NAT & address translation
- Dynamic routing (EIGRP)
- Hierarchical network design
- Enterprise services (DHCP, DNS, HTTP, firewall rules)
